<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>I have a deep passion for sports.  I love playing golf and bowling.  I enjoy listening to music.  I particularly like U2, Metallica, and good rock and metal.  I also listen to old and new Asian/Hong Kong tunes.  I love playing video/computer games when I have free time.  I do not often read literary books, but I enjoy reading technical journals, newspapers (domestic and international), and periodicals to keep up with what is going on in the world.</p>

<h3>Favorite Sport Teams</h3>
<p>I am a season ticket holder to watch the Boston University Terriers (NCAA Division 1 Men's Ice Hockey).  I follow the Miami Hurricanes and the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame in college football.  I follow Manchester United Football Club (England) in international soccer.  I follow the major Boston-based sport teams (particularly the Patriots, Celtics, and Red Sox in that order) closely.</p>
